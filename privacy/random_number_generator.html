        <p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Random Number Generator mobile application (the "App"), package name <code>org.manyara.tools.random_number_generator</code>, developed and owned by Manyara Technologies (OPC) Private Limited. This policy describes how we handle information in relation to the App. Please read this policy carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>The Random Number Generator App is designed to provide a simple utility function: generating random numbers between a start and end digit you provide. <strong>Crucially, this App does not collect, store, transmit, or access any personal information or any other data from your device or from your use of the App.</strong> All number generation and processing happen locally on your device, and no data is sent to us or any third party.</p>
        <p>We do not request, access, or track information such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, contacts, photos, microphone, camera, or any other sensitive or personal data.</p>

        <p>The App requires minimal permissions to function. It does not require permissions that would allow it to access your personal data or sensitive information on your device (e.g., contacts, location, photos, microphone, camera, etc.). Any permissions requested are solely for the basic operation of the App on your device's operating system and do not enable data collection.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our App does not integrate with or utilize any third-party services (such as analytics providers, advertising networks, or social media platforms) that would collect, transmit, or process user data from the App. The App operates entirely independently on your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect, store, or process any user data, there are no data security risks related to our handling of your information within the App. The security of your device and any data stored solely on your device is your responsibility.</p>

        <h2>5. Target Audience and Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Random Number Generator App is intended for use by individuals who understand numbers, including children aged 3 and above.
